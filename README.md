# pi-DJex
This is a project for visual feedback on volume levels in bars and concert halls.
DJex is meant to give the DJ and Bar-staff a visual feedback e.g. via a LED-Strip if a user defined threshold level is reached.
If the threshold is exceeded by a certain level of db , a relay turns on a socket outlet for a few seconds, sanctioning the DJ with non-lethal methods.
The Threshold level can be set via web interface.
